### Packages not supporting .NET Core/ .NET 5

Some packages do not currently support .NET Core or running on non-Windows platforms:

* Transports
  * NServiceBus.Transport.Msmq - `System.Messaging` is not part of .NET Core, so MSMQ can't be supported on .NET Core.
* Containers
  * NServiceBus.Spring - Spring.Core version 2.x does not support .NET Core, but Spring.Core version 3.x can be used with NServiceBus through [Spring.Extensions.DependencyInjection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spring.Extensions.DependencyInjection/).
* Hosts
  * These hosts are being deprecated and will not receive .NET Core support. They are replaced by the [ParticularTemplates package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ParticularTemplates) containing [templates for use with `dotnet new`](/nservicebus/dotnet-templates.md).
    * NServiceBus.Host
    * NServiceBus.Host32
    * NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure
    * NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure.HostProcess
* Other
  * NServiceBus.Wcf - Microsoft does not support the server aspects of WCF on .NET Core.
